# Landing Page Project

## Introduction
- This project builds a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience for the user

- This project aims to provide real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. 
The functionality will serve two purposes:  
1. Prepare and append dynamically added data to the DOM
2. Show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. 

- This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

## Setup and Instructions
- Clone the project
- Open `index.html` to view the project in your browser.
